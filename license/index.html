            <p>All the softwares built by 64DC are licensed under 64DC open source license.</p>

            <p>Open Source licenses dont have any value, so adding them to your project is worthless, you can't tell what a user can do and can not, and who even reads the great stallman license.</p>
            <p>Secondly I'm putting this stuff on internet, anyone can copy it and do whatever they want, what can I do
                even if I write in my license, that <b>You are not allowed to copy stuff and sell it to someone
                    else.</b>, No open-source creator is interested in suing someone for using their toys.</p>
            <p>So do whatever you want, not just with my code, but rather everything you find in the internet, if they
                cared about it they should not have put it on the internet.</p>
            <p>Again to re-iterate, one last time here is my license statement â€” <br>
                <b>Person downloading any product, licensed under 64DC license, is allowed to use it for any purpose
                    (including commercial) that, Person wants to do. I (the Licenser) will not be responsible for any
                    action of
                    the Person, which are performed using the licensed product.</b>
